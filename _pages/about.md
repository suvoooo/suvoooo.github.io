### _Research_

#### _Post-Doc Research_: 

Currently I'm looking for possible Dark Matter annihilation/decay signal in $$ \gamma $$-ray data, measured by [Cherenkov Telescope Array](https://www.cta-observatory.org/), using Deep Learning. Now, I am mostly working with [Dr. Gabrijela Zaharija≈°](https://www2.ung.si/~gzaharijas/Gabi.html).

After my PhD, I worked with [Dr. Shigehiro Nagataki](https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/chief/astro_big_bang/) and Dr. Haoning He on studying high energy $$\gamma, \nu$$ production from PeV $$\left( 10^{15} \text{eV} \right)$$ proton interaction with the molecular clouds near our galactic center.

#### _PhD Research_ :

For my PhD research, I was involved in searching for Dark Matter decay signal in the Cosmic-Ray $$e^+ + e^-$$ flux measured by [CALorimetric Electron Telescope (CALET)](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/calet/calet.html) on the ISS. I was lucky enough to work under the PI of CALET, Dr. Shoji Torii. I have extensively used [GALPROP](https://galprop.stanford.edu/), a numerical code for Cosmic-Ray propagation in our galaxy. For data analysis part, I have used Python and slowly I fell in love with various python libraries and, eventually with deep learning.   

Love for deep learning pushed me to take an AI Research Intern role and I mostly learned about using semantic segmentation to solve real life business problems, like- crack detection on road/walls, identify rotten bean [sprouts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck3lSTwBi78&feature=youtu.be) etc.

### _About Me_ :

When I was a little younger, while traveling and watching stars with my parents, I used to wonder how awesome it would be to study  (if I ever decide to continue studying!) about stuffs happening up there on the sky. Now, when I go on hikes or just enjoy solitude, most of the times I cannot comprehend how amazing life has turned out! Many failures, embarrasments were also part of this journey (there will be a lot more in future too). I grew to love and embrace them as much as my success stories. <br>

Apart from watching stars and hiking, I also like to play football, guitar and take photographs. You can check some selected collections of photographs [here](https://flickr.com/photos/suvob).
