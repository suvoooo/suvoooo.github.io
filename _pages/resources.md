### _Resources_

 Since I am a massive believer of free education, below I've compiled some of my favorite study materials, research papers, lectures etc. These could be of interest if you are into particle physics/astrophysics/machine learning. They are all free!

A more generic and extremely useful list of such free materials for theoretical physicists is already prepared by famous physics professor _Gerard 't Hooft_.  You can check the site: [How to Become a Good Theoretical Physicist](http://www.goodtheorist.science/).

Below goes my list:

**********************************************************

#### _Particle Physics_:

Good.

**********************************************************

#### _Astrophysics; Mostly Cosmic Rays_ :

Better.

**********************************************************

#### _Machine Learning/Deep Learning_ :

Worst.
