 Since I am a massive believer of free education, below I've compiled some of my favorite study materials, research papers, lectures etc. These could be of interest if you are into particle physics/astrophysics/machine learning. They are all free!

A more generic and extremely useful list of such free materials for theoretical physicists is already prepared by famous physics professor _Gerard 't Hooft_.  You can check the site: [How to Become a Good Theoretical Physicist](http://www.goodtheorist.science/).

Below goes my list:

**********************************************************

## _Particle Physics_:

### _Standard Model_:

  * [Introduction to Standard Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0001283).
  * [Getting Started with Noether's Theorem](http://users.physik.fu-berlin.de/~kleinert/b6/psfiles/Chapter-7-conslaw.pdf).
  * [Feynman Diagrams for Beginners](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.04182.pdf). Also, Griffiths Particle Physics Book, Appendix D.

### _Dark Matter_:  

  * [Lectures on Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03797). Also check for other TASI Lecture Notes.
  * [Fantastic Compilation of Lecture Notes on Dark Matter](http://web.mit.edu/redingtn/www/netadv/Xdarkmatte.html)

**********************************************************

## _Astrophysics; Mostly Cosmic Rays_ :

Better.

**********************************************************

## _Machine Learning/Deep Learning_ :

Worst.
