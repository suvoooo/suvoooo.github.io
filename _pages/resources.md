 Since I am a massive believer of free education, below I've compiled some of my favorite study materials, research papers, lectures etc. These could be of interest if you are into particle physics/astrophysics/machine learning. They are all free!

A more generic and extremely useful list of such free materials for theoretical physicists is already prepared by famous physics professor _Gerard 't Hooft_.  You can check the site: [How to Become a Good Theoretical Physicist](http://www.goodtheorist.science/).

Below goes my list:

**********************************************************

## _Particle Physics_:

### _Standard Model_:

  * [Introduction to Standard Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0001283).
  * [Getting Started with Noether's Theorem](http://users.physik.fu-berlin.de/~kleinert/b6/psfiles/Chapter-7-conslaw.pdf).
  * [Feynman Diagrams for Beginners](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.04182.pdf). Also, Griffiths Particle Physics Book, Appendix D.

### _Dark Matter_:  

  * [Lectures on Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03797). Also check for other TASI Lecture Notes.
  * [Fantastic Compilation of Lecture Notes on Dark Matter](http://web.mit.edu/redingtn/www/netadv/Xdarkmatte.html)

**********************************************************

## _Astrophysics; Mostly Cosmic Rays_ :

### _Cosmology Basic to Intermediate to Advanced_:

  * [Lectures notes on Cosmology](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00070).
  * [Lecture notes on Cosmology](http://www.sr.bham.ac.uk/~smcgee/ObsCosmo/Jaffe_cosmology.pdf). Contains a very intuitive explanations of rather difficult topics.
  * [Lecture notes on General Relativity](http://www.blau.itp.unibe.ch/newlecturesGR.pdf). A very comprehensive guide.
  * [Understanding CMB Power Spectrum](https://www.roe.ac.uk/ifa/postgrad/pedagogy/2006_tojeiro.pdf).
  * [CMB Power Spectrum for Pedestrians](https://astro.uni-bonn.de/~kbasu/Slides/annurev.samtleben.pdf).  

### _Dark Matter Indirect Detection_:

  *

**********************************************************

## _Machine Learning/Deep Learning_ :

### _Maths Behind Machine Learning_ :

  * [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://github.com/mml-book/mml-book.github.io/tree/master/book). Thanks to Professor [Marc Deisenroth](https://deisenroth.cc/) for making this book completely free! 	 

### Lecture Notes:
  * [Stanford Lectures Notes: Deep Learning](http://cs229.stanford.edu/notes/).
  * [Neural Net and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/).
